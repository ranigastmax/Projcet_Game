# Zombie Dungeon

**Zombie Dungeon** is a simple top-down action game written in C++ using the **SFML** library. In this game, player slay zombies using a sword or fireballs, and develop their character after each level. The game culminates in a final boss battle. 

This project was one of our first forays into game development, so the code may lack cleanliness or optimization. Nevertheless, it showcases our initial efforts in building a fun and functional game.
